DRLIM Example
===============

A very simple DRLIM example in torch using norb data.

Some of the code here is from Ross Goroshin (particularly the data processing code) and some is from Jonathan Tompson.

run ```run.lua``` to do the training.
run ```analysis.m``` after training to view the analysis.

All data will be downloaded automatically as needed.
